# Paper Title
Identification and Classification of Sexual Predatory Behavior in Online Chat-Room Environments
By Norbert Eke, Abdallah Mohamed, Jeffrey Andrews
From UBC Okanagan

# Abstract
According to the Crimes Against Children Research Center, one in five U.S. teenagers who regularly use the Internet have received an unwanted sexual solicitation via the web. There is an increasing danger in online environments such as chat-rooms, where predatory behaviour is more and more frequent, creating an unsafe environment for minors. 
This project aims to design an approach for online communities to enhance their member's safety by detecting malicious conversations of sexual nature. This project joins the powers of computational linguistics with statistical machine learning to decipher the insight lying in conversations, then make predictions on whether or not a specific conversation should be flagged for containing sexual predatory behaviour. 
The contribution of this novel approach is 2-fold: firstly, the approach is able to capture the contextual details by putting an emphasis on insight that lies within the conversation, and secondly it contains a 2 stage classification system, which is highly flexible and customizable for detecting and classifying other malicious textual data.
